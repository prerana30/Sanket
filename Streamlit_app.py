By this stage, some babies will even sleep for a full eight hours during the night (although, word of warning: don't get your hopes up). Most babies will spend twice as long sleeping at night as they do during the day â€“ e.g. eight hours at night and four hours during the day.\nMany babies aged six months to a year will no longer need a night feed and may sleep for up to 12 hours at night. However, there're no guarantees of this, and some babies may wake up in the night for a bit (or a lot) longer.\nSometimes, your baby will nod off with seemingly no effort required from you. No rocking, no shushing, no patting. Then there are the nights where your baby will fight sleep as though their little life depends on it. What's more, once she does drop off, it won't be long before she's awake again. You know she needs to sleep, but she hasn't quite got the memo.\nFor nights like these, we've compiled a guide for getting your baby to sleep. Whether you give controlled crying a go, or experiment with using a dummy, there're a number of things you can do to up your chances of getting your baby to sleep.",
